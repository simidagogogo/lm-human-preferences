WARNING:tensorflow:From /root/.local/share/virtualenvs/lm-human-preferences-XpxZn-hG/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/op_def_library.py:263: colocate_with (from tensorflow.python.framework.ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Colocations handled automatically by placer.
WARNING:tensorflow:From /root/.local/share/virtualenvs/lm-human-preferences-XpxZn-hG/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/function.py:1007: calling Graph.create_op (from tensorflow.python.framework.ops) with compute_shapes is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Shapes are always computed; don't use the compute_shapes as it has no effect.
WARNING:tensorflow:From /root/.local/share/virtualenvs/lm-human-preferences-XpxZn-hG/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/data/ops/dataset_ops.py:429: py_func (from tensorflow.python.ops.script_ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
tf.py_func is deprecated in TF V2. Instead, use
    tf.py_function, which takes a python function which manipulates tf eager
    tensors instead of numpy arrays. It's easy to convert a tf eager tensor to
    an ndarray (just call tensor.numpy()) but having access to eager tensors
    means `tf.py_function`s can use accelerators such as GPUs as well as
    being differentiable using a gradient tape.

Instructions for updating:
Use tf.cast instead.
